# Validation evidence

## Automated suite

The dependency-free test suite covers transcript reconciliation, shared parent
and subagent accounting, token HALT, STEER thresholds, repeated-call HALT,
tool-output replacement, fail-closed behavior, privacy, and concurrent SQLite
admission.

## Installed Codex test — 2026-09-03

Environment: Codex CLI on macOS, plugin installed from the repository's local
marketplace, hooks explicitly trusted for the test invocation.

Procedure:

1. Start a persisted Codex task with `tokens=10k`, `tools=2`.
2. Ask Codex to run one `pwd` command and return `OK`.
3. Inspect the local lineage ledger.
4. Resume the same task and ask for another command.

Observed result:

- The initial model request and one Bash call completed.
- Codex persisted the `token_count` total at turn completion, not before the
  Bash call. The Stop hook reconciled 47,507 observed tokens and changed the
  run to HALT against the 10,000-token ceiling.
- The next user turn was rejected by `UserPromptSubmit` before a model request:
  Codex reported zero input, output, and reasoning tokens, and no Bash call ran.
- The ledger contained `run_started`, `tool_admitted`, `tool_completed`,
  `usage_observed`, and `halt` events in that order.

This validates the advertised next-boundary circuit breaker and disproves a
stronger same-turn or zero-overshoot guarantee. The README reflects that
observed limitation.
